## Personal Interests

In my spare time I tinker with reverse engineering and malware analysis, and generally anything dealing with low level languages and operating systems.

Outside of technology, I'm a book worm, particularly enjoying classic Russian literature. I also enjoy books and articles relating to critical theory, linguistics, semiotics, and cybernetics.  

When I'm not reading or programming, I can be found outside enjoying the fresh air and trying to identify moss with various levels of success.
